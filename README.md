# Notes
A simple notepad which keeps acts like a personal journal.
This project has itself many concepts of python covered where library functions 
are used to create variable and loops are added to end the program itself. 
To ensure saving the data, file handling is used to create a file and keep the package safe. 
A time stamp is also maintained to ensure the period in the journal or note.
